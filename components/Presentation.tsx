        <p >Hi, I’m Hanane Boudlal, a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Avignon. After starting in dental school in Algeria, I switched to computer science in France, driven by my passion for math and AI. I’m especially interested in combining AI with healthcare, and I’ve worked on projects involving data analysis, prediction models, and intelligent web applications. I’m also building skills in web development to make AI more accessible through real-world tools.</p>
